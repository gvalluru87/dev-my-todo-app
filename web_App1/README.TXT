This my 1st python web app on streamlit

run this command to generate a requirements.txt file here in the project directory.

pip freeze > requirements.txt

This is a file which will be uploaded to the server where we host this web app. So that server should know all the Python libraries the server needs to install in order to run the
web app correctly. So the server has Python installed and even though it does have Python installed, it doesn't have all
the packages available third party packages.

So you have to tell that server what packages your app needs to run correctly. And these are the packages that our app uses.

So we installed Streamlit only.
